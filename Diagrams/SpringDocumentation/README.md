# Spring Documentation
This is the portion of the project that I am implementing first. If you are interested in contributing I will pretty much only be interested in code review, suggestions on how to realize the functional requirements found on my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/uBXwmjyn/investmentproject-trello), and optimization suggestions. If this interests you, please reach out using the information in the [base README](https://github.com/OWurst/PortfolioProject/tree/main#readme). To view other diagrams, return to the [diagram page](https://github.com/OWurst/PortfolioProject/tree/main/Diagrams).
