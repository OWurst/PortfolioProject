# Spring Documentation
Because I am focusing on the Core Services portion of the project first, this portion of the project will likely not be implemented or even thought about intensively for at least a couple weeks. If you are interested in contributing I will pretty much only be interested in code review and suggestions on how to realize the functional requirements found on my [Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/uBXwmjyn/investmentproject-trello). If this interests you, please reach out using the information in the [base README](https://github.com/OWurst/PortfolioProject/tree/main#readme).
