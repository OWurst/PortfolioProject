    "## Trainer Notebook\n",
    "This notebook will be used to train the models used by the prediction in what will be multi-step machine learning processes. Because I have limited experience with ML, I have elected to go with a notebook for the training logic so that I can monitor the algorithms a little more closely by completing them step by step. As I develop this, if I get to the point where I am happy with the algorithm's functionality and ability to actually predict future outcomes with some degree of accuracy, I may elect to copy and paste this code into a single file that would allow other users to simply input their training data filenames, but I will cross that bridge if it comes."
