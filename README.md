# Portfolio Project
I'm not exactly sure what this will end up being, but over the next ~6 months I want to spend a bit of time per day contributing to a project that is more deeply thought out and of larger scope than the school projects I have done. This repository is public and as I get going I am likely to need some help, particularly with the front end, so please message me at omw3@pitt.edu
## Tech Stack
I plan on using spring boot for the back end using the microservices architectural pattern. For the front end, I will be using React.js. I have not yet decided on a database/databases for this project, I think I will need to make that decision when I have zeroed in a little closer on a specific project idea.
