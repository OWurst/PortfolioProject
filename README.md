# Portfolio Project
I'm not exactly sure what this will end up being, but over the next ~6 months I want to spend a bit of time per day contributing to a project that is more deeply thought out and of larger scope than the school projects I have done. This repository is public and as I get going I am likely to need some help, particularly with the front end, so please message me at omw3@pitt.edu. My plan is for this to end up being an investment simulator, in which users are given fake money, which they invest how they see fit and track their progress over time based on the actual markets. A final goal for this project would be to suggest investments using ML.
## Tech Stack
I plan on using spring boot for the back end using the microservices architectural pattern. For the front end, I will be using React.js. I have not yet decided on a database/databases for this project, I think I will probably go primarily with sql as it is all I know.
## Difficulties
I am working as a software engineering intern this summer and will be a full time student in the fall, so it has been quite difficult to find time for this project and it will continue to be quite difficult. Hopefully I can carve out a little time each day, but it is going to be hard to build this project in 30min-1hr increments, even if I am working on it nearly every day.
